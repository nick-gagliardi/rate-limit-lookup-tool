# Real-Time Rate Limit Control Panel

## Transforming Operational Constraints into Developer Confidence

Rate limits are a dynamic and critical aspect of successful service integration. Historically, finding accurate operational constraints has created unnecessary friction and risk for developers. This project strategically migrates this critical information from static documentation to a **proactive, personalized control panel**.

Our goal is to eliminate search time, prevent unexpected limits, and provide a single, reliable source of truth so development teams can **build and scale with confidence**.

## Technical Foundation

### Dynamic Data Structure: Scalable and Accurate

The power of this tool comes from defining all rate limits—from the Free tier up to Private Cloud Performance—as **configuration directly within our standardized codebase**.

This configuration-as-code approach gives us two major benefits:

1.  **Scalability:** By treating limits as code, we can **instantly update, test, and deploy changes** to any tier across all environments. It's easy to grow the system without adding complexity.
2.  **Accuracy:** This dynamic, single source of truth is the **same code that enforces the limits**. What you see on the dashboard is precisely what is defined, guaranteeing **perfect accuracy** that instantly reflects your service agreement.

### Authentication via Auth0

We utilize our own **Auth0** platform for authentication and identity management. The secure sign-in process is the critical first step that drives personalization:

* **Secure Access:** Users leverage our robust, enterprise-grade authentication protocols.
* **Personalization Driver:** Your Auth0 profile immediately passes your specific user roles and entitlement data to the application, which then customizes the Control Panel to show *your exact*, real-time rate limits.

## ⚙️ Setup and Deployment

For operations teams looking to deploy and integrate this service, follow these essential steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have the following in place:

* **Runtime Environment:** (e.g., Node.js 18+ / Python 3.10+ / Go 1.20+)
* **Database:** Access to our standard configuration database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for storing session data and user-specific details.
* **Access Credentials:**
    * **Auth0 Tenant Details:** Client ID, Client Secret, and Domain for the application.
    * **Internal API Key:** Required to access the core service that reads the rate-limit configuration-as-code.

### 2. Server Configuration

The service relies on environment variables for security and integration. The server must be configured with these specific values:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | The ID for the application in your Auth0 Tenant. | `gA4h...` |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` | The secret key for secure token exchange. **(Must be kept private)** | `e8Fj...` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_API_ENDPOINT` | URL for the internal API that fetches the raw limit data. | `https://api.internal-limits.com/v1/limits` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for the session/user database. | `postgres://user:pass@host:port/db` |

### 3. Running the Service

The deployment process typically involves fetching dependencies, running the build, and then starting the service:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd rate-limit-control-panel

# Install dependencies (Example for Node.js)
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the server (Ensure environment variables are loaded)
npm start
